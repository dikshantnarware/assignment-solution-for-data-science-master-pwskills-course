    "# Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Tuples are ordered collections of elements, similar to lists, but with some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning the elements are arranged in a specific sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Yes, tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. However, if the elements themselves are mutable (like lists), those elements can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types. For example, a tuple can contain integers, strings, floats, and other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed: Elements in a tuple can be accessed using indices, just like lists. The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples are hashable if all their elements are hashable. This makes tuples suitable for use as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their immutability, tuples are useful for representing fixed collections of items that shouldn't change during the program's execution, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments."

    "count(): This method returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "index(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "Tuples have fewer built-in methods compared to lists because tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation. Lists, on the other hand, are mutable and have methods like append(), remove(), and insert() that allow for modifying their contents. Since tuples cannot be changed, they don't need methods for modification operations, resulting in a smaller set of built-in methods."
